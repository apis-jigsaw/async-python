However, with asynchronous programming our programs don't necessarily run one after another, but instead instead our process goes in a circle checking in on each function running it when it's ready.  This is called an event loop.  "

This tells the event loop that the function does not need to be completed beginning to end -- but rather the function is a coroutine.  The second is the word await.  We need the await because we do want to the asynchronous procedure of sleeping to be complete before the event loop can then print the lines `foursquare_call_finished`.  And while it's waiting, the `await` allows the event loop to check in on other functions.  \n",
